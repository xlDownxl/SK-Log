# SK-Log [Prototype]

This web application is intended to make every traders life easier by providing a platform for easy documentation of personal progress. 
Prototype developed to show the potential in personal finance related software. The SK-Log system will soon be ported into the SK App and integrated in the ecosystem thereof.
Currently the tags feature is disabled due to a bug. The service for automatic detection of the tradingpair linked in the chart image is currently deactivated. 

The app can be accessed here (accounts can be created without email confirmation):
